# 📖 Project Overview

AI Learning Assistant is a structured AI learning system where users:

1. Paste content
2. Select a difficulty level
3. Generate a structured explanation
4. Ask grounded follow-up questions

The application is intentionally designed using:

* Clear domain boundaries
* Server Actions as application layer
* Explicit mutation flows
* Containerized infrastructure
* Isolated dev and production environments

This project demonstrates production-ready thinking, not just UI rendering.

# ✨ Core Features (v1)

* Paste text content
* Generate:

  * Simplified explanation
  * “Explain like I’m 5”
  * Key takeaways
* Ask follow-up questions grounded in a Lesson
* Persistent lesson storage
* Clean, minimal UI
* Fully containerized environments

---

# 🔁 Application Flow

## 🧠 Full Flow: “Teach Me”

### 1️⃣ UI (Client)

* User pastes content
* Selects difficulty level
* Clicks **Teach Me**
* `<form>` submits to a Server Action

---

### 2️⃣ Server Action (Application Layer)

Responsibilities:

* Receives `FormData`
* Extracts `prompt` and `level`
* Calls domain mutation: `createLesson(request)`
* Calls `revalidatePath(...)` to refresh UI

The Server Action acts as glue — it does not contain business logic.

---

### 3️⃣ Domain Mutation

`src/lib/learning/mutations.ts`

Responsibilities:

* Validate request
* Call AI function `generateExplanation(request)`
* Construct a `Lesson` entity:

  * `id`
  * `title`
  * `originalPrompt`
  * `explanation`
  * `level`
  * `createdAt`
* Persist to database
* Return created Lesson

---

### 4️⃣ AI Layer

`src/lib/learning/ai.ts`

* Calls external AI API
* Returns explanation text only
* Contains no persistence logic

---

### 5️⃣ UI Revalidation

Because the route is revalidated:

* The page re-runs
* Lessons are queried again
* Updated list is rendered

Clean, predictable data flow.

---

## 💬 Follow-up Question Flow

When a user asks a follow-up:

1. Save user message
2. Generate AI response grounded in selected Lesson
3. Save assistant message
4. Revalidate route
5. UI updates automatically

# 🧱 Architecture Philosophy

This app follows a lightweight domain-driven structure:

| Layer                   | Responsibility              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| UI                      | Rendering & form submission |
| Server Actions          | Application orchestration   |
| Domain (`lib/learning`) | Business logic              |
| AI Module               | External API interaction    |
| Prisma                  | Persistence                 |

Principles:

* No business logic in UI
* No DB logic in AI module
* Server Actions = orchestration only
* Mutations are explicit
* Side effects are controlled

This keeps the system testable and scalable.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/learnwithalfred/ai-learning-assistant.git
cd ai-learning-assistant
```

---

# 🐳 Docker Environments

Two completely separate environments run in parallel.

| Environment           | URL                                            | DB Port |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Development           | [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) | 5434    |
| Production Simulation | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | 5433    |

---

## 🧪 Development

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Stop:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

---

## 🏭 Production Simulation

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

# 🔐 Environment Variables

Create `.env.local`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5434/ai_app_dev"
```

> ⚠️ Do not commit secrets

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=
```

---

# 🧱 Prisma Workflow

Create migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Generate client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Deploy migrations in container:

```bash
docker exec -it ai_app_dev 
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

# 🧪 Testing (Vitest)

This project uses **Vitest** for unit and domain testing.

Run locally:

```bash
npm run test
```

Watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Inside container:

```bash
docker exec -it ai_app 
npm run test
```

## Testing Strategy

* Domain mutations tested in isolation
* AI module mocked
* Database interactions validated
* Edge cases covered (invalid input, empty prompt, etc.)

# 🛠 Troubleshooting

### ❌ P1001: Can't reach database

Use Docker service name (`ai_db`, `ai_db_dev`).

### ❌ Port already allocated

```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

### ❌ Migrations missing

Ensure `prisma/` is copied in Dockerfile.
